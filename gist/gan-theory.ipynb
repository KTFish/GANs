    "\n",
    "Intuitive the lower is the generators cost function the better should be the generated image. In reality it is not so straight forward. The gerator is graded by the discriminator which improves over time and detects even verry realistic fake images. Sometimes **despite improvment in qualitu of generated images the generators loss function is growing.**\n",

    "- BCE Loss - essentially measures how bad, on average, some observations are being classified by the discriminator, as fake and real.\n",
    "  Real / Fake Distribution -\n",
    "- Earth Mover's Distance - its a measure of **how different two distributions are** by estimating the effort it takes to make the generated distribution equal to the real one.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Nice functions for creatning blocks of the neural network latter used in the class implementation as a layer.\n",
    "- The magnitude of a gradient is also called the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "- I didn't really understood how the gradient in Wasserstein GAN is calculated.\n",

    "### Questions (theory) - DO NOT PUBLISH\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is the primary goal of the discriminator, in a probabilistic sense?**\n",
    "> The discriminator finds the probability of class y (real or fake) given input features x.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is the primary goal of the generator, in a probabilistic sense?**\n",
    "> Model the features x conditioned on class y: P( x | y ).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How does the discriminator learn over time?**\n",
    "> Getting feedback on if its classification was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What should the skill levels of the discriminator and generator be? - Both should be at similar skill levels.\n",
    "- What is the difference between upsampling and transposed convolution layers? - Upsampling infers pixels using a predefined method, while transposed convolution learns a filter\n",
    "- What do the discriminator and critic have in common? - They both want to maximize the difference between the expected values of the predictions for real and fake.\n",
    "- What points on a function are considered for the evaluation of 1-Lipschitz continuity? -\n",
    "  All points on the function. The slope can not be greater than 1 at any point on a function in order for it to be 1-Lipschitz Continuous.\n",
    "- When is a function 1-Lipschitz Continuous? -\n",
    "  When its gradient norm is less than or equal to 1 at all points.\n",
    "- Why do you use an intermediate image for calculating the gradient penalty? - Since checking the critic’s gradient at each possible point of the feature space is virtually impossible, you can approximate this by using interpolated images.\n",
    "- What is a soft way to restrict the critic to be 1-Lipschitz? -\n",
    "  Adding a regularization term for the weights, as in L2 norm/regularization. By using a gradient penalty, you are not strictly enforcing 1-L continuity, but encouraging it\n",
    "> **How does the generator learn what class to generate (in Condiditional GANs)?**\n",
    "> The discriminator is checking if an image looks real or fake based on (conditioned on) a certain class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How is adding the class information different for the discriminator and generator, and why (in Condiditional GANs)?**\n",
    "> For the discriminator, the class information is appended as a channel or some other method, whereas for the generator, the class is encoded by appending a one-hot vector to the noise to form a long vector input.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is a key difference between controllable generation and conditional generation?**\n",
    "> Controllable generation is done after training by modifying the z vectors passed to the generator while conditional generation is done during training and requires a labelled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How are controllable generation and interpolation similar?**\n",
    "> They both change features by adapting values of the z vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **When does controllable generation commonly fail?**\n",
    "> When features strongly correlate with each other and z values don’t correspond to clear mappings on their images.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How can you use a classifier for controllable generation?**\n",
    "> You can calculate the gradient of the z vectors along certain features through the classifier to find the direction to move the z vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is the purpose of disentangling models?**\n",
    "> To correspond values in a z vector to meaningful features.\n"
