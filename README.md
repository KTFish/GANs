# GANs

### Repository structure

Repository combining all my work related to GANs (learning, projects, gits). In the [**theory**](./theory) section you can find my notes based on topic related to courses from [_Courseras Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization_](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans). In the [**notebooks**](./notebooks/) you will find the Python implementations.
